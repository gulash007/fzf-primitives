   PREVIEW WINDOW
       --preview=COMMAND
	      Execute the given command for the current line and display the result on the preview window. {} in the command is the
	      placeholder that is replaced to the single-quoted string of the current line. To transform the replacement string, specify
	      field index expressions between the braces (See FIELD INDEX EXPRESSION for the details).

	      e.g.
		   fzf --preview='head -$LINES {}'
		   ls -l | fzf --preview="echo user={3} when={-4..-2}; cat {-1}" --header-lines=1

	      fzf exports $FZF_PREVIEW_LINES and $FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS so that they represent the exact size of the preview window. (It also
	      overrides $LINES and $COLUMNS with the same values but they can be reset by the default shell, so prefer to refer to the ones
	      with FZF_PREVIEW_ prefix.)

	      fzf also exports $FZF_PREVIEW_TOP and $FZF_PREVIEW_LEFT so that the preview command can determine the position of the preview
	      window.

	      A placeholder expression starting with + flag will be replaced to the space-separated list of the selected items (or the
	      current item if no selection was made) individually quoted.

	      e.g.
		   fzf --multi --preview='head -10 {+}'
		   git log --oneline | fzf --multi --preview 'git show {+1}'

	      Similarly, a placeholder expression starting with * flag will be replaced to the space-separated list of all matched items
	      individually quoted.

	      Each expression expands to a quoted string, so that it's safe to pass it as an argument to an external command. So you should
	      not manually add quotes around the curly braces. But if you don't want this behavior, you can put r flag (raw) in the
	      expression (e.g. {r}, {r1}, etc).  Use it with caution as unquoted output can lead to broken commands.

	      When using a field index expression, leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from the replacement string. To preserve the
	      whitespace, use the s flag.

	      A placeholder expression with f flag is replaced to the path of a temporary file that holds the evaluated list. This is useful
	      when you pass a large number of items and the length of the evaluated string may exceed ARG_MAX.

	      e.g.
		   # See the sum of all the matched numbers
		   # This won't work properly without 'f' flag due to ARG_MAX limit.
		   seq 100000 | fzf --preview "awk '{sum+=\$1} END {print sum}' {*f}"

	      Also,

	      * {q} is replaced to the current query string
	      * {q} can contain field index expressions. e.g. {q:1}, {q:2..}, etc.
	      * {n} is replaced to the zero-based ordinal index of the current item.
		Use {+n} if you want all index numbers when multiple lines are selected.

	      Note that you can escape a placeholder pattern by prepending a backslash.

	      Preview window will be updated even when there is no match for the current query if any of the placeholder expressions
	      evaluates to a non-empty string or {q} is in the command template.
